| General topics                      | composition of spitting snake venom     |
| Procedure/ what was examined        | They examined the venoms of different snakes and they  found that spitting snakes were composed in the same  way even though they originated from very remote areas.                                                                                 |
| Conclusions,  discovery.            | There has been an evolutionary convergence between  spitting snakes so that their venom faces very badly  in order to be able to  defend themselves well against  animals that could harm them.                                                      |
