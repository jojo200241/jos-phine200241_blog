hello every one!!

I'll introduce myself my name is Joséphine Dumortier I'm in second bachelor in Biologie at UMons in Belgium.

Before, I did a year at Louvain La Neuve in the veterinary section. It was super interesting but it was not for me...

This year I am taking the English course of Mrs. Ingrid Van Lancker.

After my study I would like to teach at the end of secondary school in biology and chemistry.

Even Thurday evening and Sunday morning I give lessons in a dog club. I love that.
The funniest thing is that we realize that it is more complicated to teach the master than the dog.
