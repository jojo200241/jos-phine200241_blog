| Published in? When? (if mentioned) | The 18 May in Scientifics Report                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| General topics                     | Identify predators of starfish when  eating coral polyps. It would be good  news for coral reefs                                                                                                                             |
| Procedure/ what was examined       | To do this, we analyze the guts and  excrements of reef fish to find out  which are predators of crown of thorns.  It would then be possible to suppress their epidemics and therefore avoid the  destruction of the polyps. |
| Conclusions,  discovery.           | There are more species of fish than  expected that can eat thorn crown.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Remaining questions                | If we increase the number of predators  of the thorn crown, are we not going to  risk its disappearance?                                                                                                                     |
