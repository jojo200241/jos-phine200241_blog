| General topics                     | Spider webs are said to have a paralyzing toxin.                                                                                                             |
| Procedure/ what was examined       | First he observed, then he analysed the active genes  and proteins in the silk glands of banana spiders,  finally we tested the active substance on insects. |
| Conclusions,  discovery.           | Thanks to the analysis of the active genes present  in the web, they were able to confirm the presence of  proteins resembling known neurotoxins.            |
| Remaining questions                | Does the toxin act directly on contact? Is it really used as a toxin and not as a deterrent?                                                                 |
