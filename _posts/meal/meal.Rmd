Since my second year of high scool I have had English lessons.
In secondary I had four hours of English per week, then I had two hours per week during my year at Louvain La Neuve.
Last year I didn't have any English and this year I also have two hours of English per week.

To improve my English outside of class:
I regulary watch my favorite movies in English (as I know them by heart, I understand more easily what they say)

My mom's best friend boy friend is english, when they come home I love to talk with him!
For the moment I don't see him much anymore because he is stuck in England...
