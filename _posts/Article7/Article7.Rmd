| Procedure/ what was examined        | First they do experiment on mice, then they will do a  test in Africa on humans. Knowing that before all this, research had already been done on white man when testing for the use of this drug to prevent heavy metal poisoning |
| Conclusions,  discovery.            | Scientists have discovered that a drug against heavy metal poisoning can have effects against some snake venom. But these pills have no effect on the venom which targets  the nerves instead of the blood                        |
