| General topics                     | The discovery of a new family of toxins  contained in the thorns of an Australian  tree                                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure/ what was examined       | Search for the molecular structure of the  toxin, and then search for the primary  structure of the protein                                                                                                                                  |
| Conclusions,  discovery.           | The researchers found that the neurotoxin  produced by the stinging tree Gympie-Gympie  possesses a class of small proteins similar  to the toxins of spiders and cone snails.  There is therefore a parallel evolution  with animal toxins. |
| Remaining questions                | Why is this plant so poisonous? Does it have  any particular predator?                                                                                                                                                                       |
